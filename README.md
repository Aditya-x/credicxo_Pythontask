## About the Project
### Scraping product details from Amazon from given ASIN and country domain.


## Technology Used
### I used Selenium, BeatifulSoup and, Request libraries to scrape the data 


## Project Description 
### So While solving this assignment i faced many challanges like First when i tried to scrape it using BeautifulSoup only it was returning "Null" and after researching a bit i got to know that BeautifulSoup alone is no more able to scrape the data from Amazon So i used selenium, Another challange I faced was pages were often different from others so html tags were not matching and it was throwing error so to solve that i used "Try and Except" method and after scraping i stored all the data in dictionary and converting it to dataFrame that later converted it into json file.
### I used postgreSQL server to dump my data
### For Captcha Validation i tried OpenCV And pytesseract my approach was to read the text from image and apply it Eventually it was not so accurate.
